PROLOGUE

Sitting upon the bridge of the ISS Manticore, Captain Des Spike mindlessly scrolled past the lastest headlines.

Captain.

Thirty years ago, he would have given anything to be in this position - in command of a supercruiser, out in the middle of nowhere - but that was {startYear} years ago. Then, everyone assured him he had a bright future, that he would make admiral one day - and for a while he {soared?}. He made Lieutenant Commander {x} years ago, then commander, then captain. People still reassured him then; told him that - given the officer-shortage - he’d get a promotion to the admiralty in five or six years. 

That was {y} years ago. He had done nothing of value since; shuttling delegates here and there and cataloguing nebulae - and, sure, that was important, but it wasn’t what he joined the navy for. It wasn’t the constant thrill of discovering new life and new civilisations that those officers that stood on the right side of the admiralty enjoyed. But just because he made one mistake; one error in judgement {y-1} years ago, as a newly promoted captain, he was sidelined; cast aside. //possibly remove ‘cast aside’

In the Cotton massacres, he stood up to his commanding officer, one Admiral {insignificant c.o. Name here}, and refused to fire on walls of civilians who were doing nothing but protesting. And that - officially - was the right choice. Unofficially, howerver, that made him a traitor. That made him someone who could not be trusted; someone who betrayed the naval brotherhood. 

In the years since, he had stood idly by as he watched other officers - some four or five years junior to him - get promoted to flag-rank; get command of various fleets, and doing what he should have been doing - going out there and exploring. But time and again he was passed over. //remove this maybe?

No matter. He was doing his job (charting the {system-name} nebula), and doing it well - even if that did mean reading sensationallist articles about how antimatter usage kills people and how there were(for the second time this month) futile protests about military reform and how warp drive “destabilizes your neuronic energy”.

Leaning back, he sighed in boredom, and closed his eyes.

Just over three-hundred light-years away, Admiral {Astelan-char-name} of the Astelans was celebrating his promotion aboard the AS {Astelan-ship-name}.
{IMPORTANT: decribe celebration. He feels tired at the end.}

The comms beeped, jolting him from his half-sleep. He groaned, and with great effort peeled open an eyelid - which saw that his friend, {astelan-friend-char-name} was going to get it.

The eyelid fell shut.


CHAPTER ONE
Six hours later, {Astelan-char-lastname} stepped onto the bridge - dimming his visor as he did(he had a head-splitting migrane) - and was greeted by complete chaos.

Clearly, something had happened. He remembered - vaguely - that someone had tried to reach him last night. But - no, that simply couldn’t be related - they would have tried harder. Wouldn’t they?
