The kinetic particle theory explains the properties of the different state as of matter

The particles in solids, liquids, and gases have different energies

Solids - particles very close together, no space to move into
Regular arrangement
Particles vibrate on the spot
Fixed shape, cannot flow
Particles cannot ove from place to place, very strong forces hold them in place
Cannot be compressed or squished
Ver dense
Low energy

Particles close together
Random arrangement
Particles move around each other
Can flow and take the shape of their container
The particles can move around each otherForces between particles are less effective
Liquids cannot be compressed or squashed
Quite dense
Particles have more energy(than solids)

Gases
Particles far apart
Random arrangementparticles move quickly in al directions
Gases flow and completely fill their container
No forces of attraction between particles
Gases can be compressed or squashed
The particles are far apart and have space to move into
Very low densities
Particles have lots of energy


Melting point = freezing point
Boiling point = condensation point

Melting point is when the particles vibrate so much, they break away from their posiitons(attractions aren o-longer strong enough to hold them in position)

Solid becomes a liquid

When heated solid particles gain more energy, vibrate more



Freezing / solidifying
When a liquid is cooled, the particles lose energy - they vibrate less as they slow down

Eventually, the forces of attraction are enough to stop them moving, except for vibrations in fixedd positions

A solid has now formed

Liquid is heated so strongly that particles move fast enough/have enough energy to break all forces of attraction

Bubbles of gaseous particles rise to the surface forming a gas


Evaporation

Not all particles in a liquid contain the same amount of energy - some have more!

This is why evaporation of a liquid can take place below its boiling point

Condensing
When you cool a gas, the particles lose energy
This loss in energy causes the particles to move mores lowly as they move closelr together

Attractions hold the particles together as a liquid

Under some conditions, some solids turn straight into a gas - sublimation

Old carbon dioxide only exists as a liquid under high pressure

Iodine - purple/black crystals to purple vapour 



Solid to liquid - melting
diffuion is the spreadig out of particles in a gas or liquid from an area of high concentration to low concentration. 
particles in gas and liquid are free to move
in gas, particles are moving very fast.

For diffusion to happen through particles must bounce off each other to go in all directions - that’s why it taeks a whie to smelll the deoorant.

judrochloric acid + ammonia ->  ammonium chlorid.


hcl and NH3(Hydrochloric acid and ammonia) join near the HCl to become a salt. HCl is heavier - relative mass of 36.5 as opposed to ammonia’s 17 - thus the ammonia travels faster down the tube and thus the salt - NH4Cl - is formed near the left.

We could increase the speed of diffusion in the tube by reducing the volume of the tube, the amount of liquid, and by heating.



diagram - the hot permanganate rose up faster than the warm, which in turn rose faster than the cold.

Diffusionc an occur in liquids and gass but not in solids because in liquids and gases the particles are free to move around; free to diffuse.

Diffusion was likely faster in gases a
potassium iodide and lead nitrate are able to diffuse even though they are solids because they dissolved in water.


distillled water has a fixed boiling pointand melting point because it only has water molecules in it

pure compounds and elements hve fixed boiling and melting points
mixtures have a boiling range and melting range.
